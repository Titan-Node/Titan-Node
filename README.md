# Titan Node Overview

I am Titan, Crypto Punk #8728, Bitcoin Foundation Member since 2014 and a node operator for various crypto projects.

Based in Canada, we operate one of the largest "Video Mining" Pools on the Livepeer network and run professional node infrastructure for the EigenLayer network.

If you are looking to [earn passive income from your idle GPUs](https://app.titan-node.com/download.html) or want a reliable node operator to stake your [LPT](https://explorer.livepeer.org/accounts/0xbe8770603daf200b1fa136ad354ba854928e602b/orchestrating) or [ETH](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/operator/0x72355fa820dbe85ccdc9d6a81afa75f8de6b5766), look no further.
